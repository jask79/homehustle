## SCRIPT 1: The Lifestyle Reveal

### Hook Options (test all):
- A: "I quit my 9-to-5 three months ago. Here's what happened."
- B: "This time last year I was broke. Now watch this..."
- C: "Nobody believed me when I said I'd work from home. Look at me now."

### Body:
```
[HOOK]

I know what you're thinking — "another side hustle scam."

But hear me out.

I started with zero experience. Zero audience. Just a laptop and 
two hours a night after work.

[PAUSE — look away, then back]

Month one? Made $400. Not life-changing, but real money.

Month three? $2,000. That covered my car payment AND groceries.

Now? I make more from this than my old job. And I work half the hours.

The best part? I'm not special. I just found something that 
actually works and stuck with it.

[LEAN IN]

If you want to see exactly what I did — step by step — 
comment "GUIDE" and I'll send it to you.

No BS. No course to buy. Just the real playbook.

[POINT AT CAMERA]

Your future self will thank you.
```

### CTA Options:
- "Comment GUIDE below"
- "Link in bio for the free blueprint"
- "Drop your email — I'll send it direct"

## SCRIPT 2: The Warning Hook

### Hook Options:
- A: "Stop applying to work-from-home jobs. I'm serious."
- B: "If you're still trading time for money, we need to talk."
- C: "This is the money mistake I made for 10 years."

### Body:
```
[HOOK]

I spent years applying to remote jobs. Getting rejected. 
Settling for less.

Then someone told me something that changed everything:

[PAUSE — serious face]

"You don't need a job. You need an income stream."

That hit different.

So instead of chasing another application, I built something 
small on the side. Just 5 hours a week.

First month — barely anything.
Third month — $800.
Six months in — it replaced my income.

[LEAN BACK, more casual]

Now I wake up when I want. Work where I want. 
No boss. No commute. No BS.

And it all started with one simple side hustle that 
most people have never heard of.

[POINT DOWN]

I made a free guide breaking down exactly how I did it.
Comment "FREE" and I'll send it your way.
```

## SCRIPT 3: The Proof Stack

### Hook Options:
- A: "$3,400 last month. From my phone. Let me show you."
- B: "Just got my payout notification. [show phone] This is real."
- C: "They said side hustles don't work. Here's my bank account."

### Body:
```
[HOOK — show phone or gesture to screen]

No, this isn't some get-rich-quick thing.

I've been doing this for 8 months. Here's what I've learned:

[COUNT ON FINGERS]

One — it takes time to build. Anyone who says otherwise is lying.

Two — you don't need to be an expert. I literally learned 
everything from YouTube.

Three — consistency beats talent. I'm not special. 
I just didn't quit.

[DROP HANDS, direct to camera]

The side hustle I'm doing? It's perfect for people with 
full-time jobs. Because you can work on it whenever you want.

Morning. Night. Weekends. Doesn't matter.

[SOFTER TONE]

If you're tired of living paycheck to paycheck...
If you want more than a 3% raise once a year...

This might be for you.

[CTA]

Tap the link in my bio. I put together a free starter guide.
It's the exact roadmap I wish I had when I started.
```

## SCRIPT 4: The "Secret" Hook (FOMO play)

### Hook Options:
- A: "I wasn't supposed to share this, but..."
- B: "My mentor is going to kill me for this..."
- C: "Okay, deleting this in 24 hours, but you need to know..."

### Body:
```
[HOOK — whispered, conspiratorial]

There's a side hustle that most people don't know about.

It doesn't require:
- A degree
- A big following  
- Any money to start

And no, it's not dropshipping. It's not crypto. 
It's not selling courses.

[NORMAL VOICE]

It's something I stumbled into by accident last year.

I was making $200 a week within the first month.
Now it's closer to $200 a day.

[LEAN IN]

The crazy part? Only like 2% of people are doing this.
Which means there's still room. For now.

But I'm not going to gatekeep it.

[GESTURE]

I wrote up a simple guide explaining what it is, 
how to get started, and the mistakes to avoid.

Comment "SECRET" and I'll DM it to you.

But seriously — don't sleep on this one.
```

## SCRIPT 5: The Relatable Struggle

### Hook Options:
- A: "I was $14,000 in credit card debt. Then I found this."
- B: "I used to check my bank account with one eye closed."
- C: "Rent was due in 3 days and I had $47 in my account."

### Body:
```
[HOOK — vulnerable, real]

I'm not telling you this for sympathy.

I'm telling you because if you're where I was...
stressed about money... working hard but going nowhere...

I get it. I really do.

[SHIFT TO HOPEFUL]

Here's what changed for me.

I stopped trying to "save" my way out of being broke.
And I started focusing on making more instead.

One side hustle. 2 hours a day.

It wasn't instant. I'm not going to lie to you.

But after 6 months? I paid off that debt.
After a year? I had savings for the first time in my life.

[DIRECT]

Now I help other people do the same thing.

Not with some expensive course. Just with a free guide 
that shows you exactly what I did.

[CTA]

Comment "GUIDE" or check the link in my bio.

You deserve to stop stressing about money.

Let's make it happen.
```

## AVATAR RECOMMENDATIONS

For these scripts, test with:

| Avatar Type | Scripts | Why |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| Young woman, casual (25-32) | #2, #5 | Relatable to female audience |
| Guy next door (28-38) | #1, #3 | Trustworthy, "regular person" |
| Professional mom type (32-45) | #4, #5 | Appeals to parent demo |
| Diverse mix | All | Test and see which resonates |

## PRODUCTION NOTES

- **Length target:** 45-60 seconds (algorithm favors longer watch time)
- **Speed:** 1.1x playback often sounds more natural
- **B-roll ideas:** laptop in coffee shop, phone notifications, cozy home office
- **Music:** Lo-fi beats or trending sounds (check TikTok Creative Center)
- **Captions:** ALWAYS. 80% of viewers watch without sound.

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. Pick 2-3 scripts to start
2. Create 3 versions of each (different hooks + avatars)
3. Post and track performance
4. Double down on winners
